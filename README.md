Hi Bonnie, could you check please my testUtils setup file (router)? It's a bit different project from that we have on the course, but all test utils logic is the same. 

So I was interested in how I can modify the setup from the course to use it with React Router v6+ (in my example I use 6.4) and with new testing util from React Router (createMemoryRouter). The main goal was to achieve the same or at least very close functionality in test files (access to history and location) but without the usage of the history library and history object directly, because in this project I don't use history.push() for navigation.

All setup is in testUtils folder, index file. And a few tests in src/features/countries/CountryList.test.tsx file.

I will be glad to any advice or comments. Thank you!
